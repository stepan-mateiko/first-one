          Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
          looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to
          <ins>their own section.</ins> Continue reading for an introduction to
          the documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

          React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
          applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With
          React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as
          well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
          components: <em>bundles of reusable, nestable code.</em> You can learn
          more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
          components work in React Native.

        <p>
          React Native runs on <ins>React</ins>, a popular open source library
          for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of
          React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can
          get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
        </p>
        <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to React
          uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need
          names and a cafe to work in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that
          lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
          <span class="highlight"
            >&lt;Text&gt; Hello , I am your cat! &lt;/Text&gt;.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The React docs have <ins>a comprehensive guide to JSX</ins> you can
          refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
          variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
          <span class="highlight">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding
          it with curly braces inside
          <span class="highlight">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments
          you use to configure how components render, state is like a
          component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data
          that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State
          gives your components memory!
        </p>

      <section class="handling-text">
        <h2 class="heading">handling text input <sup>Chapter 4</sup></h2>
        <p>
          TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
          has an <em>onChangeText</em> prop that takes a function to be called
          every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
          function to be called when the text is submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
          their words into a different language. In this new language, every
          single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there
          Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
